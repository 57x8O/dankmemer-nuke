# DANKMEMER Infinite Money!

*Do not skid or else you suck at life!*

This chunk of code allows you to get a discord bot or self bot to get infinite money using the `pls beg` command with [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol).

If there's any issues, obviously create a new issue and I'll try solve it.

## How to use:

-> `git clone` this git and edit the main python file and change the token variable and paste in your token. Now, run the python file. When the client has been connected with Discord, you can now type "pls!start" in the Discord server that has the Dank Memer bot in it. It has a `while True:` statement, so it will repeat.
